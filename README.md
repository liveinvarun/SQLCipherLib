# SQLCipherLib

The library is wrapper over the original java lib sqlcipher lib 3.4.5 for xamarin android. This will be particularly useful for the dev team who are looking to upgrade the sqlcipher for Android N dev. 

The lib includes a sample db creation source which is a sanity that lib works in xamarin android environments.

Please feel free to contribute as this is initial version of the lib.
